This assignment is about making a BigInteger ADT in C++. The main program will be an executable named Arithmetic that takes in an input file, and runs differnet arithmetic operations on two integers and prints them out to the specified outfile.
## Files
Arithmetic.cpp - C file that contains source code for main executable Arithmetic

List.h - Header file containing functions for List.c

List.cpp - C++ file containing source code for List ADT

ListTest.cpp - Test file for List ADT

BigInteger.h - Header file containing functions for BigInteger.c

BigInteger.cpp - C++ file containing source code for BigInteger ADT

Makefile - Makefile to build and compile files

## Building
make - compiles Shuffle

make clean - removes compiled files

make Check - runs valgrind  

## Running
Arithmetic - ./Arithmetic < argument > 

ListTest - ./ListTest

BigIntegerTest - ./BigIntegerTest

Check - ./Check
